           SHREYA!</h2>
        <p>And Rich Cuisine is my little corner of the internet!</p>  
            
          <p>  I'm the voice, author, and creator behind Rich Cuisine. What started as a casual hobby over 10 years ago in 2010 while I was working as a fourth grade teacher has now grown into a full-blown business (!!) that reaches millions of people with fun recipes each month, with content that has been featured on The Kitchn, CNN, Refinery29, Brit + Co, POPSUGAR, Huffington Post, The Everymom, PureWow, and more.
            
            I live in Saint Paul, MN with my husband Bjork and our dog Sage. My favorite things in life are a big plate of pad Thai, sunny days, and going to the dog park.</p>
